# Box

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS _font-size_ property.

### Best practices

-   Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.

## Properties

<Props of={Box} />

## Basic usage

```javascript
import { Box } from 'quarks-ui/subatomicParticles';
```

<Playground>
    <Box styling="row">Row</Box>
</Playground>
