# H1

Search engines use the headings to index the structure and content of your web pages. Users often skim a page by its headings. It is important to use headings to show the document structure.

Each HTML heading has a default size. However, you can specify the size for any heading with the style attribute, using the CSS _font-size_ property.

**Note:** Use HTML headings for headings only. Don't use headings to make text BIG or bold.
